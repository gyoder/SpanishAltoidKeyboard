# SpanishAltoidKeyboard
A project I did over a free day that lets you type acented characters into a windows computer using alt codes  
---
I don't speak spanish (im only in spanish 2) so this might be utterly useless for typing in spanish. This was just somthing I thought of when I was looking up alt codes for the umptempth time to get my project done. Its not pretty, or very functional but it was fun to make as it was really the first time I made and arduino project (other than some learinging I did in 5th grade).

  I used a random amazon board that poped up when I searched for arduino pro micro (its somthing like Arduino Leonardo, i had to use that board when uploading the program) and some buttons and speaker wire I had laying around. Its nothing fancy, I just took a drill to the altoid can and had fine* results. I have almost no experiance soddering so thats why it looks so bad. (sorry that thats the only picture i have, the thing is all taped up and im woried i might break it)  
  ![picure of a rats nest, wait thats just the wiring that i did](https://github.com/gyoder/SpanishAltoidKeyboard/blob/main/keyboardinside.jpg)  
   I decided to go with just using alt codes for this. For those who are unaware, in windows if you hold down the alt key and push numbers on the numpad, you can get whatever ascii or unicode character that you get. Its nice and convenient except that if you use linux or macos it wont work. There are ways of doing it on those platforms, on linux its shift + alt + ctrl, but i decided to go with the windows solution for this project. I dalily drive linux but I do schoolwork on windows. It would be very posible to add other os support with little code rewriting and a toggle switch or somthing (v2 maybe). Anyway this just has a function that will take whatever 3 digit altcode you want. It has to pad a zero but by the point I figured that out, i had already made stupid code to divide and mod numbers to get the individual characters. Lets talk about that garbage. I had made code to use integer division and modulous devision to get the numbers. Its bad and long, i should have just used strings to do it. besides the [post i found](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/keyboard-write-with-number-pad-keys-from-leonardo/175304/3) made me realise that i couldnt just add the code of the numpad 1 to make it work. (btw if you want to just send [the scancodes listed on pg 53 of this pdf](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf) then just add 136 to it for it to work. The built in keyboard control is weird). I did a janky if statmement to check if the number is zero to send the correct code, its dumb.  
     
  anyway here is the stuff so if you want to make it, im sorry for my code and documentation being bad
